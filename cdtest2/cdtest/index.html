<p><h1>The Story</h1></p>
<em>The Life and Death of Tommy Chaos and Stacey Danger tells the tale of a romantic adventure</em>
<p><em>“He thought he’d seen everything, been everywhere”</em></p>
<p>Dinosaurs have invaded Earth, but neither Tommy nor Stacey care anymore, now that they’ve met each other. They escape the war, but whether they dive to the bottom of the ocean or fly to Outer Space, conflict always seems to find a way into their lives.</p>
<p>Think Blue Valentine meets Jurassic Park.</p>

<p><h1>The Vision</h1></p>
<p>We go to the movies not to just escape, but to confront the dreams and desires that haunt and inspire us.</p>
<p>Grizzly Bears and Astronauts. Deep-sea Divers and Dinosaurs. These are the things that make an amazing Adventure. And in our case, Adventure is a metaphor for Love (with a capital L).</p>
<p>Through the literal and symbolic ups and downs, Stacey and Tommy fight the idea that maybe they just weren’t made for each other.</p> 
<p>We will be building real trenches, in addition to a Spaceship and Submarine all inside a studio. By combining old school visual effects, stop-motion animation and a cut-out DIY aesthetic, an extremely unique mix of live-action and animation will be used to achieve a distinct look that sets us apart from other films.</p>

<p><h1>The Director</h1></p>

<p>Michael Lukk Litwak spent his youth making mischief in Los Angeles, California. He graduated early from high school and escaped to New York City where he enrolled in the Film and TV program at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. </p>

<p>As a Freshman he founded The Tisch 48-Hour Film Festival and was the cinematographer on a feature documentary in Istanbul, Turkey. As a sophomore he built a miniature floating city for The Glue King & His Castle and was the cinematographer on short documentary that filmed in Todos Santos, Guatemala. </p>

<p>He then flew to Prague in the Czech Republic to study at the prestigious Film Academy (FAMU) where he proceeded to hang off the side of a speeding garbage truck to film French Quesadillas, which landed an official selection at the Seattle International Film Festival and Palm Springs International Shortsfest, in addition to film festivals across the US.</p>

<p>After living in Madrid for a semester, Michael returned to New York City to build a giant glowing cardboard spaceship in his basement for Interstellar Intercourse: A Space-Sex Odyssey. Interstellar clinched the Audience Award at Tisch 48-2012 and continues to play the festival circuit.</p>

<p>The Life and Death of Tommy Chaos and Stacey Danger is Michael’s NYU thesis film and the ultimate expression of everything he’s learned in the last four years.</p>

<p>He has plans to conquer the world as soon as he figures out how to turn his surplus of compassion and empathy into some sort of explosive death-ray chainsaw laser.</p>

<p>OLIVER ANDERSON - CINEMATOGRAPHER</p>

<p>is a New York City based cinematographer and fellow graduate of Tisch School of the Arts. He has a history and reputation of creating dynamic, stunning imagery influenced by a diversity of mediums and personal experiences. He’s shot commercials, music videos, and recently wrapped Principle Photography on his first feature, shot on location in Virginia last Spring. Budgets shrink and grow, but good filmmaking comes down to strong ideas and powerful execution, a motto that he strives to keep in mind.</p>

<p>He’s worked with a wide range of directors in almost every style, from B-movie horror to historical drama to comedy to fashion. While some people think about a production based on camera technology and technical challenges, Oliver carefully approaches each project with a great deal of care, collaborating with directors about the ideas and intentions present in the script.</p>

<p>This is Oliver and Michael’s second time working together, the first being Interstellar Intercourse: A Space-Sex Odyssey.</p>
